# OpenInventory v2.0

## OpenInventory has been deprecated and is highly recommended to be replaced by another framework as this was just a project to teach me how to make production modules.

OpenInventory is a back-end form of inventory managment for general use in Roblox.
This provides which many open-source inventory systems don't, *Customizability*.
With OpenInventory, you're not just limited to player inventories, you can make shared storages, private storages, chests, loot containers, etc. with a rather simple and self-explanatory API.
